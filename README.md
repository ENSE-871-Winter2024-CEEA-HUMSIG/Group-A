## Project Description

The purpose of this project is to create an online platform for the Special Interest Group (SIG) "Humanities in Engineering" within CEEA-ACÃ‰G as communities of practice. The purpose of this platform is to help group members collaborate, share knowledge, and network via maps. By incorporating features like member profiles and collaborative tools, this platform can improve group visibility and interaction. In actuality, it gives members the chance to express their areas of interest in study.

## Background Summary

The integration of humanities viewpoints into engineering education is the subject of a Special Interest Group (SIG) within the Canadian Engineering Education Association (CEEA). Since its founding in 2017, the SIG has worked hard to unite a community of scholars, educators, and practitioners who are passionate about examining the nexus between engineering and the humanities. This group's activities include organizing frequent gatherings, exchanging research, and eventually enhancing the engineering education community.

## Business Needs & Opportunity

The "Humanities in Engineering" SIG has to deal with problems including misaligned interests, insufficient visibility, inefficient contact possibilities, and network mapping. These difficulties appear to be impeding the growth of cooperation and the recruitment of new participants in the engineering education community. As such, the development of a user-friendly, bilingual web platform is imperative. They will be able to efficiently communicate with possible partners, highlight events, and convey their research interests thanks to this. In details,

**Promote Seamless Collaboration:** This platform's main objective is to offer an approachable setting that promotes smooth cooperation across SIG members. Our goal is to create a dynamic and active community by optimizing communication and project cooperation through the integration of cutting-edge collaborative tools.

**Knowledge Sharing using Maps:** The platform will allow users to visually display and share their knowledge by utilizing the power of maps. In addition to improving the educational process overall, this special feature will make the field more dynamic and participatory, allowing members to explore a wider range of viewpoints.

**Increase Group Visibility:** The "Humanities in Engineering" SIG will be much more visible as a result of the addition of member profiles and modifiable areas of interest. Members will be able to display their knowledge thanks to this feature, which will promote a sense of solidarity and community pride.

**Possibilities for Networking:** The platform will provide SIG members with specific networking opportunities because it understands the value of networking. Building strong professional ties and a strong support system is the aim, whether accomplished through discussion boards, in-person gatherings, or targeted interactions.

**Multi-Language Support:** One of the main goals is to make sure that the online platform can support the various linguistic preferences of SIG members by putting in place a strong multi-language support system. This feature will improve the "Humanities in Engineering" SIG's accessibility, inclusion, and involvement while cultivating a genuinely global community.

**Simple and Low maintenance:** Creating a platform that is easy to use and requires little upkeep is a major goal of the project. Through an emphasis on design and functionality simplicity, the platform seeks to lessen the administrative load, freeing up SIG members to concentrate on information sharing and cooperation instead of technological intricacies.
